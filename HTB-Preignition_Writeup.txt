Step1:
  Run nmap to check for the answer to question 3 and 4. 
  nmap -sV <target_IP>
  We see that the Host is up and tcp port 80 is open and hosting an nginx 1.14.2 webapplication 
  
Step 2: 
  Pretty sure the challenge wants you to enumerate with gobuster based on the questions but I used dirb as a force of habit, the results were the same either way. 
  This will give the answer to questions 7
  dirb http://<target_IP>
  and we see http://<target_IP>/admin.php (code 200) telling us that dirb found an admin login page directory on our target webserver
  
  Step 3: 
    Navigating over to the admin login page we are prompted to enter a user name and password. This was an easy guess on my first try 
    Username: admin
    password: admin
    **It may have not even mattered what was entered 
    hitting enter/clicking login will generate a webpage containing the flag.
