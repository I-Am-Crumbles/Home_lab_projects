Q1: What service version is found to be running on port 80?
A1: nginx 1.14.2

Q2: What is the 3-digit HTTP status code returned when you visit the machine?
A2: 302

Q3: What is the virutal host name the webpage expects to be accessed by?
A3: ignition.htb

Q4: What is the full path to the file on a linux comptuer that holds a local list of domain name and IP address pairs?
A4: /etc/hosts

Q5: What is the full URL to the Magento login page?
A5: http://ignition.htb/admin

Q6: What is the admin password to the Megento login page?
A6: qwerty123

Q7: Submit root flag
A7: 797d6c988d9dc5865e010b9410f247e0

Step1: 
  run nmap -sV to determine the version of the service on port 80 to answer the first question
  sudo nmap -sV <target_IP>
  We see that tcp port 80 is open to http traffic and is running nginx 1.14.2

Step2: 
  I initially try to navigate over to the web page but I was denied. No error code was outright displayed (however the answer to question 3 was)
  I checked the network tab but the request headers also did not display the error code
  Checking the hint for the problem reveals we were supposed to use curl
  curl -v http://<target_IP>
  This will output a lot of useful information including the error code we were looking for, 302 Found.

Step3: 
  We next need to edit the /etc/hosts file to contain the <target_IP> <Domain Name> pair
  in my case I took the following steps on the cammand line
  sudo vim /etc/hosts 
  The file will open and then we add "<target_IP> ignition.htb" to the file, save and exit
  You should now be able to navigate over to the Web application on the iginition machine
  
Step4: 
  Directory busting, this time I chose to give gobuster a try
  gobuster dir --url http://ignition.htb/ --wordlist /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
  This yielded a few results, all of which can be seen on the google docs version of this write up which contains screenshots.
  The one we are interested in is /admin which is the answer to Q5.
  
Step5:
  We are given the user name by the requirement of needing to answer question 6. Unfortunately this web application has defenses against brute forcing passwords
  If too many incorrect attempts are made too quickly you get locked out for a couple of minutes
  So we have to guess it manually through trial and error
  Unfortunately the best way to do this is to just google for "Most common admin passwords of 2022" and you will get any number of lists to start working through
  I personally used https://nordpass.com/most-common-passwords-list/ and the answer was number 48 for the US for all genders "qwerty123"
  **If you're wondering if I litterally guessed all 48 passwords I did not, this is an old machine so I Just used google at this point. 
  **However since this is how you would have to do it in real life I outlined the process. 
  
Step 6:
  Once you have guessed the password and logged in the flag is displayed right there on the first page you see.
