        Custom Built Gaming PC turned virtual machine host

Device 2 is currently used to host virtual machines. At the moment it hosts 1 attack machine and whatever vulnerable box I am working through. 
Overall this device serves as a more Sandbox environment for me to work in that, if need be, can easily be wiped and restored with out losing too much data in the process

Device 3:
        Lenovo Ideapad P400 Touch
